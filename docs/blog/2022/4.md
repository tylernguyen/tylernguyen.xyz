# The Death of Phan Thanh Giản

![[Phan Thanh Gian.jpg|300]]

### First Treaty of Saigon

Đại Việt, now Việt Nam, early 1800s:

Emperor Nguyễn Ánh (Gia Long), in part due to his eldest son Prince Cảnh’s conversion to French Catholicism, started a period of distancing from Western missionaries and merchants. Following his lead, the succeeding Emperor Minh Mạng persecuted Vietnamese Catholic converts, and would eventually give orders to execute a French and two Spanish missionaries. Having failed to diplomatically negotiate religious and trade concessions from the Vietnamese, Franco-Spainish forces, fresh from their battles in the Opium War, initiated the conquest of Southern Vietnam’s capitals and port cities, eventually capituring Sài Gòn, Biên Hòa, and Vĩnh Long. Battles would end with the First Treaty of Saigon- Dai Nam (Vietnam) additionally ceding Gia Định and Định Tường, signed and negotiated by an envoy led by Phan Thanh Giản.

### 1863 - Embassy to France

Due to this role in the First Treaty of Saigon, now Emperor Tự Đức sent Phan Thanh Giản as ambassador to France to negotiate a return of some loss provinces and French protectorate status in exchange for yearly tributes, commercial settlements, and the hope of the French would stay out of the rest of Đại Nam. The Vietnamese was greeted in Toulon by a 17-cannon salute, and would be shown the advancements of French civilizations in the next weeks. Having seen their technological superiority, Giản kowtowed and pled his case in tears in front of Napoleon III. Though an agreement would not be reached, with the Vietnamese party leaving with promise that a French answer would be given in the coming year.

On hist return, Gian’s account of French powers and advancements was downplayed and dismissed by Emperor Tự Đức. Then, he had lost hope of convincing the Emperor that forceful interventions would end in the destruction of Vietnamese cities and people.

France would eventually propose a position similar to that offered by Giản, wanting to keep Sai Gòn, and important port cities, while returning the rest in exchange for tributes. Emperor Tự Đức, however, demanded additional modifications in favor of the Vietnamese, effectively rejecting the proposal.

Following the breakdown in treaty-making, France started the conquest of Đại Nam in 1867. Ultimately losing lands under his protection, Giản stopped eating and committed suicide by opium overdose- having felt he failed his country and people.

> Từ ngày đi sứ tới Tây Kinh,  
Thấy việc Âu Châu phải giật mình.  
Kêu gọi đồng bang mau kịp bước,  
Hết lời năn nỉ chẳng ai tin…

> Since my embassy to the Western Capital,  
Startled by the state of Europe I could see,  
I called upon colleagues to wake up quickly  
All my pleas were in vain, nobody believed me..
