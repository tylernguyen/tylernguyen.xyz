__Modern email usage made it a unique identifier and tracker. An email address commonly used across multiple (important) accounts can be especially vulnerable to targeted attacks. Consider treating your emails as you would passwords: 1 main email and multiple alises.__

## Preface: Old Email Habits and Usage

### The Email Pipeline

Email is the pillar of day-to-day internet life, needed for:

- creating accounts
- shopping (receipts, warranties, claims)
- subscriptions/newsletter sign-ups
- work contacts
- file sharing (mostly documents)

### Old Email Habits

The average Andy likely has:

- a personal email address (probably Gmail)
- a work email address (mostly powered by Gmail or Outlook)
- a spam email address (some random address made ages ago)
- a legacy email address tied to old accounts (likely made when you were young)

!!! warning

	Your email provider, be it Google (@gmail) or Microsoft (@outlook) owns your email accounts, by virtue of owning said domain. Remember that when the service is free, you are the product!


## Cleanup: Search and Destroy

### Old Email Accounts

Legacy email accounts are particularly vulnerable to attacks, especially targetted attacks. Look for old email accounts and delete them. Reduce the number of email accounts down to a minimum. Make sure that no currrent accounts are linked to old addresses as you'll no longer have access after deletion.

!!! info

	The majority of email providers will have an option to export data before deletion.

### Compromised(Pawned) Addresses

Data leaked from security breaches are usually linked with an email address.

!!! tip

	[Have I Been Pwned?](https://haveibeenpwned.com/), developed by [Troy Hunt](https://www.troyhunt.com/about/) allows you to check if personal data associated with a particular email address has been compromised.

I recommend a scan of all email addresses with Have I Been Pwned. Consider deleting addresses with a high amount of data breaches.

## Solution: Email Aliasing

!!! note

	"Emails as Passwords" assumes that you already have a habit of using a password manager. Priority #1 should be setting up a password manager and 2fa.

### 1. Buy a Domain

## Email Security, Privacy, and Availability

## Why I don't Self Host Emails

Ignoring technical reasons related to email SPAM, the prime reason against self-hosting the maintenance effort required for a properly configured email server. **Email is something that should just work!** With self-hosting, consider that you have to:

1. Have the technical know-how and corresponding troubleshooting skills
2. Get a server up and running
3. Choose an email solution and configure said software
4. Harden and secure the finished product against security threats

None of these steps are particularly difficult, but what they are is time consuming. And protecting a server against (targeted) attacks can be very maintenance heavy. And time spent on creating, maintaining, and upgrading a self-hosted email solution is time wasted.
