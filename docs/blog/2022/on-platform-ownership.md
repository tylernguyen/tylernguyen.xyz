## Introduction

In the age of big data and targeted analytics, it is essential that we become self sufficient, independent, and vigilant in owning our identity, work, and information. Consider that,

Platforms come and go. Companies inevitably:

1. Gets hacked and leak data
2. Fail and go away
3. Gets acquired (and go away)
4. Change in the name of profit

You can always pack your bags and move onto whatever the next trendy platform is. There are problems with that, however:

1. **Privacy**. You never really owned your data. Platforms you become apart of inevitably use its collected data to sell and advertise. This becomes worse as you change services.
2. **Security**. Your attack surface gets bigger as you use more platforms and services. Companies, especially newer startups not have the infrastructure and man-power to focus on security. And information gained from data breaches are continually used to attack the next target. 
3. **Trust**. There are only so many providers you can trust. This is especially important when it comes to services such as emails, instant messaging, file sharing, computer backups, and data archival.
4. **Cultivation**. Why work on the fields of others as a peasant? Instead, build and grow your own independent platform.
5. **Monetization**. Money is undoubtedly important. There are costs to doing work. And there must be incentives for doing them well. A monetization scheme that is at the whim of corporate shareholders can often be incompatible and unethical; It may also add overheads to costs, passing along higher prices to uesrs and consumers.

## Buy a Domain

The initial price of a domain is is reasonably inexpensive. Once purchased by an entity, however, their aftermarket price can be greatly inflated. This is especially true for common names and for TLDs such as `.com`.

Hence, it is a good idea to purchase multiple domains of your likings even if you don't have any imediate plans for them.

I like `.xyz` and `.email` TLDs for starting personal purchases. Alternative, consider applicable TLDs such as `.me`, `.dev`, `.wiki`, and `.blog`
