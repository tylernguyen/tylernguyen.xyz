# A Brief Background of Topre
Named after its design company,  [Topre Coporation](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Topre_Corporation), 

Topre is a rubber-dome type keyboard switch with tactile feedback. The switch itself works by compressing a conical spring inside the rubber dome, thereby giving a keypress signal the capacitive sensing PCB.  Hence, the nature of Topre's **tacticle feel comes not from any mechanical switch, but from the rubber dome** that sits between the conical spring and slider housing.

So whereas you might swap switch in MX-style board, the equivalent in Topre would be swapping its domes.

As of writing this on 8/25/2021, the following Topre domes exist:

- Topre 30g
- Topre 45g
- [Deskeys 35g](https://deskeys.io/products/des-domes-bke-tactile?variant=33022120329251)

- [Keyclack BKE 65g V2](https://www.keyclack.com/collections/for-sale/products/bke-topre-dome-replacements-v2)

I have, per the post's titled, spent quite a bit of money on buying and testing these domes. Hence, this is my best [ThereminGoat](https://www.theremingoat.com/) impression in trying to review and rank these domes.

Of course, these rankings are **purely anecdotal**.

# Tactility

1. Keyclack BKE V1
2. Keyclack BKE V2
3. Deskeys / Topre

Whereas stock Topre and Deskey domes has a softer resistance bump when compared to MX-styled switches such as the Boba U4(t) or the Zealios V2. The Keyclack BKE V1 has a much more sharped and defined tacticlity bump, similar to the MX-styled switches mentioned above. Finally, the Keyclack BKE V2 lies somewhere in between the two, (in my opinion) somewhere closer to the V1 but is not quite as defined.

# Weight

1. 56g (only available with Deskey Domes)
2. 50g (only available with Keyclack BKE domes) / 49g (only available with Deskey Domes) **1g is indistinguishable**
3. 40g (only available with Keyclack BKE domes) / 42g (only available with Deskey Domes)  **2g is, again, indistinguishable**
4. Topre 45g
5. 35g (only available with Deskey Domes)

**NOTE:** It is inherently hard to rank dome weights. Different domes offer different weights. Hence, in judging the feel of various dome weights, the inhernet tactility of the dome itself also has an effect. In addition, comparing two weights (when they are different domes) bring in other variables that I cannot account for. 

I should preface this by acknowledge that I am a fairly heavy-handed typer.  And though my typing speed hovers around ~114wpm, with a low of ~90wpm and peak of ~125wpm, I mostly type with only about 3 fingers from each hand (space with right index). In my expereince, typers like myself would also love a slightly heavier weight.

On the opposite spectrum, people I know who touch-type with 5 fingers usually prefer lighter weights.

That said, objectively speaking, anything past 56g would feel fatigiing even during a short computer session, while anything below 35g does not offer enough feedback in typing.

**NOTE:** Unlike MX-style switches, Topre is capacitively triggered. Hence, if you have a QMK compatible controller, the actuation sensitivity can be adjusted. Consider as a factor to **judge weight as only switch feel, not neccessarily weight as bottom out.**

# Final Rankings

1. [Keyclack BKE 50g V1](https://www.keyclack.com/collections/for-sale/products/bke-topre-dome-replacements)
2. [Keyclack BKE 40g V1](https://www.keyclack.com/collections/for-sale/products/bke-topre-dome-replacements)
3. Topre 45g
4. [Deskeys 35g](https://deskeys.io/products/des-domes-bke-tactile?variant=33022120329251)

Concluding notes:
- [Keyclack BKE 40g V1](https://www.keyclack.com/collections/for-sale/products/bke-topre-dome-replacements) a sweet spot for most people and my first recommendation. It's great if you already like the stock Topre 45g weight but would like to a bit more tacticility.
- [Keyclack BKE 50g V1](https://www.keyclack.com/collections/for-sale/products/bke-topre-dome-replacements) is my personal favorite dome. It's great for someone who wants both: increased tactility and actuation weight.
- Topre 45g is a perfectly adequate dome. If you are happy with this dome, I would recommend to resist Reddit hype.
- [Deskeys 35g](https://deskeys.io/products/des-domes-bke-tactile?variant=33022120329251) is recomended only if you know yourself to favor light switch feels. 
- Unmentioned domes are not recommended, as they:
	1. Are not worth the cost over stock
	2. Are too heavy/light to be practical
