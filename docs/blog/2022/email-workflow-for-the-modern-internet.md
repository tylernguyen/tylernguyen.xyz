### Pain! Emails, Email Addresses, and Email Inboxes

The average Andy likely has:

- a personal email address (probably Gmail)
- a work email address (mostly powered by Gmail or Outlook)
- a spam email address (some random address made ages ago)
- a legacy email address tied to old accounts

!!! tip

	Don't be an internet peasant, buy land(domains)!

Your email provider, be it Google (@gmail) or Microsoft (@outlook) owns your email accounts, by virtue of owning said email domain. Remember that when the service is free, you are the product!

## The Email Pipeline

Email is the pillar of day-to-day life, needed when:

- creating accounts
- shopping (receipts, warranties, claims)
- subscriptions/newsletter sign-ups
- work contacts
- file sharing (mostly documents)

## Why It's the Way It Is


### Email Security, Privacy, and Availability

#### Why I don't Self Host Emails

Ignoring technical reasons related to email SPAM, the prime reason against self-hosting the maintenance effort required for a properly configured email server. **Email is something that should just work!** With self-hosting, consider that you have to:
1. Have the technical know-how and troubleshooting skills
2. Get a server up and running
3. Choose an email solution and configure said software
4. Harden and secure the finished product against security threats

None of these steps are particularly difficult, but what they are is time consuming and maintenance heavy. And time spent on creating, maintaining, and upgrading a self-hosted email solution is time wasted.
