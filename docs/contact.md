    I would prefer for messages to be encrypted, even if its content is non-sensitive.

=== "What I'll definitely respond to ✅"

  - Meaningful replies, critiques, and/or thoughts on things I have written/published are always welcomed. I take criticism fairly well and will do my best to express my thoughts in responding.
  - Genuine topic suggestions, that is: a recommendation with purpose, reasons, and some background information. 
    - Ex: "Please look into X, I've found to be very useful in dealing with Y situation and is a better solution than Z." or "Please write about X topic, I read your previous Y page and the two seems connected. So it would be great to see a new perspective on the two together."

=== "What I may or may not respond to ❔"

  - I try and respond to technical queries but would prefer and suggest you try Google first.
  - If your message doesn't explicitly look like it needs a response: being vague or unclear what the purpose is, you may not hear back from me.

=== "What I'll definitely **NOT** respond to ❌"

  - I don't do pen pals.
  - [Don't ask to ask, just ask.](https://dontasktoask.com/)
  - [The XY Problem](https://xyproblem.info/)
  - No guest posts, linking, cross-promotions, and/or solicitations will be accepted.
  - Do not bump my email inbox by sending another email without substance. By doing so, you are annoying me and lessening a chance that I will reply.
