!!! note

    I would prefer for messages to be encrypted, even if its content is non-sensitive.

!!! success "What I'll DEFINITELY respond to."

    - Meaningful replies, critiques, and/or thoughts on things I have written/published are always welcomed. I take criticism fairly well and will do my best to express my thoughts in responding.
    - Genuine topic suggestions, that is: a recommendation with purpose, reasons, and some background information. 
      - Ex: "Please look into X, I've found to be very useful in dealing with Y situation and is a better solution than Z." or "Please write about X topic, I read your previous Y page and the two seems connected. So it would be great to see a new perspective on the two together."

!!! question "What I MAY or MAY NOT respond to."

    - I try and respond to technical queries but would prefer and suggest you try Google first.
    - If your message doesn't explicitly look like it needs a response: being vague or unclear what the purpose is, you may not hear back from me.

!!! failure "What I'll definitely NOT respond to"

    - No guest posts, linking, cross-promotions, and/or solicitations will be accepted.
    - Do not bump my email inbox by sending another email without substance. By doing so, you are annoying me and lessening a chance that I will reply.
