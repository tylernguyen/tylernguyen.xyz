### PC

I prefer to have seperate environments for work and play. Hence,

Gaming PC:
- Alienware AW2521H Monitor
- ASUS ROG Strix X570-I AM4 Motherboard
- AMD Ryzen 7 5800X CPU
- AMD Radeon RX 6900XT GPU
- 64GB of RAM

Work Hackintosh:
- B360M Mortar MS-7B23 Motherboard
- Intel i7-8700
- AMD Radeon RX 6900XT
- 32GB DDR4 RAM

Away from home, or on my bed, my ThinkPad X1 Carbon 6th Gen ([running macOS](https://github.com/tylernguyen/x1c6-hackintosh)) is a favorite to do light work on. It also serves as my distraction free writing machine.

I have an iPad Mini mostly serving as my media consumption device: watching and reading. Similarly, I have a Razer Blade 15 for on-the-go gaming.

### Audio

My audio peripherals include the Schiit Modius and Magnius stack, paired with, by order of preference:
- Massdrop x Focal Elex
- Massdrop x Beyerdynamic DT 177X GO Headphones 

For recording and voice, I have an Electro-Voice RE20 hooked up with the Elgato Wave XLR.

### Mouse

For micing and not so accurate FPS flicks, I rotate between:

- G Pro x Superlight
- Viper Ultimate Wireless
- Viper 8K Hz Wired
- Glorious Model O Wireless
- Logitech MX Master 3 is my preferred travel and laptop mouse.

â€” whichever my hand feels comfortable with that day.

### Keyboard

The main keyboard is usually my modded FC660C with the Norbauer Heavy-6: Urbi et Orbi edition case, BKE Redux Light v1 domes, MT3 Serika keycaps, with a custom QMK-compatible controller from Hasu.
I also rotate it with a similarly modded FC980C and a Mode65 built with Alpaca linear switches.
