### PC

I prefer to have seperate environments for work and play. Hence,

=== "Workspace PC"

    - Alienware AW2521H Monitor
    - ASUS ROG Strix X570-I AM4 Motherboard
    - AMD Ryzen 7 5800X CPU
    - AMD Radeon RX 6900XT GPU
    - 64GB of RAM

=== "Gaming PC"

    - B360M Mortar MS-7B23 Motherboard
    - Intel i7-8700
    - AMD Radeon RX 6900XT
    - 32GB DDR4 RAM

=== "Laptop"

    Thinkpad X1 Carbon 2018/6th Gen [running macOS](https://github.com/tylernguyen/x1c6-hackintosh)

### Audio

My audio peripherals include the Schiit Modius and Magnius stack, paired with, by order of preference:

For recording and voice, I have an Electro-Voice RE20 hooked up with the Elgato Wave XLR.

### Mouse

For micing and not so accurate FPS flicks, I rotate between:

- G Pro x Superlight
- Viper Ultimate Wireless
- Viper 8K Hz Wired
- Glorious Model O Wireless
- Logitech MX Master 3 is my preferred travel and laptop mouse.

â€” whichever my hand feels comfortable with that day.

### Keyboard

The main keyboard is usually my modded FC660C with the Norbauer Heavy-6: Urbi et Orbi edition case, BKE Redux Light v1 domes, MT3 Serika keycaps, with a custom QMK-compatible controller from Hasu.
I also rotate it with a similarly modded FC980C and a Mode65 built with Alpaca linear switches.
