### Threat Model

### 1Password

!!! recommendation

    ![1Password](/assets/img/uses-this/1Password-banner-light.svg#only-light){ align=right }
    ![1Password](/assets/img/uses-this/1Password-banner-dark.svg#only-dark){ align=right }

    1Password is my preferred password manager. It also manages any OTP multi-factor authentication I need.

### Yubikey

!!! recommendation

    The **Yuibkey** was one of the first security keys. It has a wide range of features such as for [Universal 2nd Factor (U2F)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_2nd_Factor), [FIDO2 WebAuthn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAuthn), PGP and One-Time-Pad (OTP) authentication. One of the benefits of this key is that one key can do everything.

    The firmware is not open source and cannot be updated without purchasing a new key.
