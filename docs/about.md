???+ question "Who are you?"

    I'm a UT Austin graduate with a degree in mathematics. In my spare time, I consume an absurd amount of popular entrainment and culture. I'm also an avid gamer and Magic the Gathering player.

???+ question "What is your blog about?"

    The blog does not have an overaching theme. Though I mostly write about popular culture and technology.

???+ question "Where are you?"

    IRL, I'm based in Texas, USA and can be reached via the [contact page](contact.md).
