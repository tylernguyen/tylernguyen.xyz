## Hardware üîß

### PC

I prefer to have seperate environments for work and play. Hence,

Gaming PC:
- Alienware AW2521H Monitor
- ASUS ROG Strix X570-I AM4 Motherboard
- AMD Ryzen 7 5800X CPU
- AMD Radeon RX 6900XT GPU
- 64GB of RAM

Work Hackintosh:
- B360M Mortar MS-7B23 Motherboard
- Intel i7-8700
- AMD Radeon RX 6900XT
- 32GB DDR4 RAM

Away from home, or on my bed, my ThinkPad X1 Carbon 6th Gen ([running macOS](https://github.com/tylernguyen/x1c6-hackintosh)) is a favorite to do light work on. It also serves as my distraction free writing machine.

I have an iPad Mini mostly serving as my media consumption device: watching and reading. Similarly, I have a Razer Blade 15 for on-the-go gaming.

### Audio

My audio peripherals include the Schiit Modius and Magnius stack, paired with, by order of preference:
- Massdrop x Focal Elex
- Massdrop x Beyerdynamic DT 177X GO Headphones 

For recording and voice, I have an Electro-Voice RE20 hooked up with the Elgato Wave XLR.

### Mouse

For micing and not so accurate FPS flicks, I rotate between:

- G Pro x Superlight
- Viper Ultimate Wireless
- Viper 8K Hz Wired
- Glorious Model O Wireless
- Logitech MX Master 3 is my preferred travel and laptop mouse.

‚Äî whichever my hand feels comfortable with that day.

### Keyboard

The main keyboard is usually my modded FC660C with the Norbauer Heavy-6: Urbi et Orbi edition case, BKE Redux Light v1 domes, MT3 Serika keycaps, with a custom QMK-compatible controller from Hasu.
I also rotate it with a similarly modded FC980C and a Mode65 built with Alpaca linear switches.

### Design

- Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator are what I initially learned, and stuck to until today. I only do very light design/mockup work so I've been reluctant to learn alternatives.

</div>

- Unraid as the OS for home server. Docker as its best friend.
- Plex is my temple. It has all sorts of movies, television, anime, audiobooks, and high-fidelity music that I‚Äôve hoarded over the years.
- Plex Dash, Plexamp, and Prologue are great companion apps to the Plex server.
- I also supplement my needs with Spotify, Audible, Libby, and Pocket Casts.
- Books and comics are organized and served via OPDS, and is usually read on my iPad Mini with KyBook 3.

### Slacking

- [Discord](https://discord.com/) ¬†as the modern chat room alternative. I belong to way too many servers/communities. It‚Äôs also basically an instant messenger between my friends.
- Reddit is as close as I‚Äôll ever get to having social media.

### CLI

- `winget` on Windows, brew on macOS for software management.
- Debian under WSL 2 on Windows.
- Alacritty is my preferred terminal emulator.
- `fish` is my favorite shell, mostly because of its autocomplete.
